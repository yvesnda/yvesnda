# Hi there, I'm Yves 👋

I'm a full-stack developer with 4 years of experience working with different languages and frameworks including PHP, JAVA, and JavaScript. I have experience working with Laravel, CakePHP, Springboot, and NestJS for backend development, and React and Angular for frontend development. I am proficient in using tools like Git, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, GitLab Pipelines), Docker, Kubernetes, and Jenkins.

Apart from my experience as a full-stack developer, I am also interested in artificial intelligence and have recently started learning more about it. I am looking to explore opportunities to work in this field and develop my skills further.
